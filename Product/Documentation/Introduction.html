  CI Factory was born out of a desire to quit writing unique build scripts for
  every new project. There are some papers that talk about this in detail:

    to setup a .NET Development Tree Wrapup</a></span> by Mike Roberts

</ul>

  The goal of the project is to provide a standard workspace that when conformed
  to CI Factory will be able to build with little to no customization. The
  workspace described in
  <span><a href=http://jayflowers.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26 rel=nofollow title="A Recipe for Build Maintainability and Reusability">A
  Recipe for Build Maintainability and Reusability</a></span> is utilized by CI
  Factory. CI Factory uses the industry standard tools to accomplish the goal.
  CCNET and nAnt are the core products that are used. A workspace produced by CI
  Factory is self contained, it has its own CCNET server, CCNET dashboard, and
  copy of nAnt. This means that there is nothing about CI Factory that prevents
  a host machine from hosting more than one CI Factory produced workspace. Each
  workspace can vary independently and experience downtime without disturbing
  others. The main build script, like sub main, does very little in the way of
  visible functionality. It manages the high level control flow, setup, and
  teardown. The functional work is performed by packages can by the main build
  script. A Package can provide functionality to the build through nAnt targets
  and build reports. A target script must adhere to an interface, simply provide
  a setup and teardown target. A target script will be accompanied by a
  properties script as well. The targets provided are like functions and and the
  properties are like parameters. Targets are designed to take full advantage of
  the standard workspace and contribute to the standard. This situation allows
  the goal to be achieved easily. For example build a .NET product. The
  workspace defined requires that the Visual Studio solution file be placed in a
  particular directory(C:\Projects\&lt;projectname&gt;\Current\Product) and
  named in particular format(&lt;projectname&gt;.sln). This allows for a script
  that will work for an project that follows the standard. CI Factory is bundled
  with several packages, there are several independent packages, and you can
  write your own. To create a workspace for your project you will need to select
  a set of packages that meet your needs.
