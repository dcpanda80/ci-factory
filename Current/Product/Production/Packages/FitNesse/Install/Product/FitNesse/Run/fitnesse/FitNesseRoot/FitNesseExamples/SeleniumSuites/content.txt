Please note that this is not a suite, it contains suites.  Often with Selenium tests you want to execute the same suite of tests against different browsers.  You can make use of !-FitNesse-! variables, suites, and symbolic links to create a single suite that is executed against various browsers.  Notice below the suites named after browsers and the one suite named !-RegressionSuite-!.  The !-RegressionSuite-! has no variable definition, the other suites contain a symbolic link to the !-RegressionSuite-!.  This allows you to maintain one set of tests for various browsers.
