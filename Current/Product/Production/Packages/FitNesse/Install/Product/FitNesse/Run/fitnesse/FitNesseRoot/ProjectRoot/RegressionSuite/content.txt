!2 Purpose
This suite holds tests for work that has been completed in previous iterations.  All tests in this suite should pass.  If a test breaks it should be fixed '''immediately'''.  There is no need to create a new bug in Target Process; this is treated just like a broken build, meaning it interrupts other tasks.
