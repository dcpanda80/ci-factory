CI Factory is moving from Berlios to Google Project Hosting.  I had been using some of the
services of Berlios combine with Morten Mertner's Confluence/Jira and my own Joomla.  I
would rather have it all hosted by the same service provider so Google wins.
=== Wiki ===
I have not decided on the best place to relocate the old wiki content to yet.  At the
moment the Google Groups Pages seems to be the best fit.  Though I am betting that after
JotSpot is fulling absorbed into Google's infrastructure it will be the best spot.
=== Source ===
I have not uploaded the source just yet.  I hope to do that soon.
=== Downloads ===
I have mirrored all the downloads here at Google Project Hosting.  I will not remove what
is currently available for download on http://www.jayflowers.com nor will I update it with
new releases in the future.
